- Create an initial network
- Until condition is met
	- Replace a piece of the network with a possibly more optimal replacement
	- Check if that makes it better
		- If it doesn't, revert the change
		- If yes, then keep it

	- Remove the practically unnecessary parts of the network, if needed

	- Make it so that it has less constants, if needed
